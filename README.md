# FinanceBuddy

FinanceBuddy is a web application that helps users track and categorize their SMS-based financial transactions. Using machine learning (or rule-based) models, it extracts relevant data from raw SMS transaction messages, such as amount, vendor, and timestamp, and categorizes them into predefined financial categories (e.g., Food, Transport, Shopping).

## Features

- **User Registration & Login:** Users can register and securely log in to access their transaction data.
- **SMS Transaction Categorization:** Users can input raw SMS messages, and the system will extract relevant information and categorize the transaction automatically.
- **Transaction History:** Users can view their categorized transactions, including details such as timestamp, vendor, amount, and category.
- **Expense Tracking:** The app stores categorized expenses and tracks spending by category.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Flask (Python Web Framework)
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Password Hashing:** Werkzeug Security
- **Environment Variables:** Python-dotenv
- **Frontend:** HTML, Jinja2, Bootstrap
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Placeholder for categorization (could be rule-based or ML-based)
